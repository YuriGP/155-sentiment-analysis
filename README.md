## Article 155 analysis

### Background

As a result of the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution in Catalonia in 2017, I made an analysis of the tweets and Twitter users who shared their opinion to the subject.

To do so, tweets which includes the word '155' has been analyzed in order to know the trending ones. I have considered a trending tweet as the ones which has been retweeted and favorited the most and have been published by influencers.
Additionally, I have done a sentiment analysis for those tweets to know which is the general feeling of Twitter users, including the shared sentiment from those influencers.

### Implementation

* The code can be run on RStudio.
* A Twitter Access Token should be generated and added to the code. [Reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html)
* Due the high amount of tweets, it's easy to reach the Twitter API limits. The amount of tweets and user profiles can be customized.

### Result
Although the general feeling towards the 155 was neutral, the positive sentiment was slightly higher than the negative.
